simple direct.

generate a typical weekly schedule based on what homework they have, what school activities 
clubs and associations) 
they could participate in, and what sports they could play

-- interview students / get a sample schedule

for one week, entire day—not just a school schedule.

Perhaps 6AM to 11-11:30PM -- possible student feedback, should be asleep 

weekends and time they will get to sleep (hours)

Classes

No—I think we can plug regular school hours into the interface for each day 

?	Extracurriculars
Yes—both after-school activities and sports (both practices and games). 


?	how should the number of hours per week be displayed?

I’m thinking of a daily one week schedule that starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.
?	should we include number of hours per day?


In addition to the one week calendar that the interface produces, it would be nice to include that “total time commitment” and the calculation. 
?	should there be a listed schedule for each day?

Yes—but just for the four main categories (school day, homework, school activities (clubs and associations), and sports).



o	what format should it be in? 
?	ex:  website, app, etc
?	Can we choose the platform?


SQL, databases 

Ruby backend/ python 

node for the website 

bootstrap

(maybe) wordpress blog within 

for updates

•	When will we get the correct data for time hours?
I think I should be able to get it for you in no more than two weeks (1/15), perhaps sooner. 

broader averages and estimates

web based everything.
